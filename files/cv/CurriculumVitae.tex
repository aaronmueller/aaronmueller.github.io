\documentclass[10pt]{article}
\RequirePackage[T1]{fontenc}
\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc}

% LaTeX will typeset using Computer Modern Roman, which a lot of
% non-mathematicians and non-engineers won't like. Also, a few PDF
% viewers may not render CMR very well. Instead, Times New Roman can
% be used. That's what this package does.
\usepackage{times}

% The automated optical recognition software used to digitize resume
% information works best with fonts that do not have serifs. This
% command uses a sans serif font throughout. Uncomment both lines (or at
% least the second) to restore a Roman font (i.e., a font with serifs).
% (NOTE: This requires the times package above)
%\renewcommand{\familydefault}{\sfdefault}

% This is a helpful package that puts math inside length specifications
\usepackage{calc}

% This package helps LaTeX auto-hyphenate hyphenated words if you use
% special hyphens. For example, bio\-/mimicry will properly hyphenate
% ``mimicry'' if necessary.

%         PAPER SIZE, PAGE NUMBER, AND DOCUMENT LAYOUT NOTES:
%
% The next \usepackage line changes the layout for CV style section
% headings as marginal notes. It also sets up the paper size as either
% letter or A4. By default, letter was used. If A4 paper is desired,
% comment out the letterpaper lines and uncomment the a4paper lines.
%
% As you can see, the margin widths and section title widths can be
% easily adjusted.
%
% ALSO: Notice that the includefoot option can be commented OUT in order
% to put the PAGE NUMBER *IN* the bottom margin. This will make the
% effective text area larger.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE THE ``of LASTPAGE'' next to each page number,
% see the note about the +LP and -LP lines below. Comment out the +LP
% and uncomment the -LP.
%
% IF YOU WISH TO REMOVE PAGE NUMBERS, be sure that the includefoot line
% is uncommented and ALSO uncomment the \pagestyle{empty} a few lines
% below.
