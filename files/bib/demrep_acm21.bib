abstract = {The #MeToo movement on Twitter has drawn attention to the pervasive nature of sexual
harassment and violence. While #MeToo has been praised for providing support for self-disclosures
of harassment or violence and shifting societal response, it has also been criticized
for exemplifying how women of color have been discounted for their historical contributions
to and excluded from feminist movements. Through an analysis of over 600,000 tweets
from over 256,000 unique users, we examine online #MeToo conversations across gender
and racial/ethnic identities and the topics that each demographic emphasized. We found
that tweets authored by white women were overrepresented in the movement compared
to other demographics, aligning with criticism of unequal representation. We found
that intersected identities contributed differing narratives to frame the movement,
co-opted the movement to raise visibility in parallel ongoing movements, employed
the same hashtags both critically and supportively, and revived and created new hashtags
in response to pivotal moments. Notably, tweets authored by black women often expressed
emotional support and were critical about differential treatment in the justice system
and by police. In comparison, tweets authored by white women and men often highlighted
sexual harassment and violence by public figures and weaved in more general political
discussions. We discuss the implications of this work for digital activism research
and design, including suggestions to raise visibility by those who were under-represented
in this hashtag activism movement. Content warning: this article discusses issues
of sexual harassment and violence.},
