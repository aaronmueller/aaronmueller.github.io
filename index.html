	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<div class="row">
		<p>Hi, I'm Aaron! I like helping computers interact with natural human language.</p>
		<p>I'm a first-year PhD student in computer science at Johns Hopkins University, affiliated with the Center for Language and Speech Processing. I work on improving language technologies&mdash;primarily machine translation and information extraction. My research interests include endangered/low-resource language varieties, machine translation, sociolinguistics, and pragmatics. I am supported by a National Science Foundation Graduate Fellowship.</p>
		<p>I completed my B.S. in computer science and B.S. in linguistics at the University of Kentucky (UK), where I was a Gaines Fellow and Patterson Scholar. My thesis, which focused on neural machine translation for Canadian French, was advised by Ramakanth Kavuluru. Additional research at UK included predicting student grades with deep learning (advisor: Nathan Jacobs), diachronic corpus linguistic/sociolinguistic analyses of gender (advisor: Mark Richard Lauersdorf), and endangered language preservation&mdash;primarily San Juan Quiahije Chatino (advisor: Hilaria Cruz).
